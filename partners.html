However, because of her passion for traveling, and learning languages and cultures, she ended up at NYUAD. She is currently a sophomore majoring in Political sciences and minoring in both chinese and arabic.</p>

                            <p><strong>Why I Joined:</strong> Berenice has always wanted to join CGF since she attended in my freshman year. She loves the forum, and finds their talks extremely informative and just a great resource where we can learn more about the UAE and its international and geopolitical relationships with countries like China.</p>
                            <p><strong>What I Hope to Achieve:</strong> She hope that CGF successfully achieves what it achieved with her when she first saw it: educated and sparked her interest in the China-Gulf relationships and their role in the future geopolitics.</p>
                            <p><strong>Anything to Share:</strong> She loves how even though we could easily dismiss and think that the Chinese and Gulf culture are very different, a common factor is how they use tea (tea in china and karak tea in the UAE) as a drink to bond over and strengthen relationships.</p>

Her passion lies in understanding the intricate relationships between economic systems, governance, and societal development.

                        <div class="flip-card-back">
                            <p><strong>Why I Joined:</strong> Nicoleta joined the CGF because of my deep interest in the economic, political, and cultural dynamics of the Gulf region and its evolving relationship with China. As an Economics major with a strong passion for global affairs, she is particularly intrigued by the strategic partnerships, trade agreements, and investment flows that shape this relationship. This opportunity allows her to explore these dynamics, engage in insightful discussions, and connect with experts and peers who share her curiosity. </p>

She wants to explore how economic interdependence is reshaping global power dynamics and what this means for the future of the region. She aims to engage in thought-provoking discussions with my peers and uncover perspectives that often go unnoticed. Most importantly, she wants to contribute meaningfully, whether by offering her own insights or working on initiatives that foster a better understanding of this critical partnership to a wider audience.</p>
                            <p><strong>Anything to Share:</strong>Something that Nicoleta finds interesting about the Gulf and Chinese culture is the shared theme of hospitality. In the Gulf, the tradition of offering Arabic coffee and dates symbolizes generosity and respect, while in China, the tea culture reflects mindfulness and social bonding. They highlight the beauty of connection through similar rituals.</p>
