                <h2>Business, Economics, & Finance Panel</h2>
                <h3>Starting From QFII: New Dynamics of Asset Allocations in China, Gulf, and Beyond</h3>
                <p>The growing trade and overseas direct investments (ODIs) between China and the Gulf have paved the way for more sophisticated investment channels. A significant milestone came in 2020 and 2021 when China eased restrictions on the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) and Qualified Domestic Limited Partnership (QDLP) scheme. By removing investment quotas, simplifying application processes, and relaxing ownership requirements, China has established a path to facilitate multilateral investments across a diverse range of asset classes, especially between the Gulf region and China.
                    Similar efforts have also been seen in the Gulf states which brought enormous growth in the financial sectors for the past decade contributing to regional economic diversification. This panel will explore the evolving role of asset allocation and financial institutions in fostering investments between China and the Gulf. The discussion aims to explore the opportunities and challenges of investing in these regions, the broader implications for asset allocations across emerging markets, and the mechanisms needed to strengthen cross-regional financial cooperation.</p>

                <h2>International Trade & Relations Panel</h2>
                <h3>Redefining Global Collaboration: The UAE, China, and the Future of the Global South</h3>
                <p>The rise of the Global South as a formidable force in international economic and political affairs is reshaping the global order. With emerging economies forging stronger alliances, the UAE has positioned itself as a key mediator and innovator in this transformation. Its active participation in multilateral initiatives—such as the launch of the Centre for Industrial Competences and exploration of alternative financial systems—demonstrates its commitment to fostering financial sovereignty and regional cooperation. 
                    China, as a leading economic powerhouse, and the UAE, as a strategic trade and financial hub, are uniquely poised to bridge economic and policy gaps between the Global South and Western economies. Their collaboration extends beyond traditional trade relations to encompass financial innovation, digital currency adoption, and the push for de-dollarization. As nations across Africa, Asia, and Latin America seek greater autonomy in financial and industrial development, the UAE and China can serve as catalysts for inclusive growth and sustainable partnerships. 
                    This panel will examine how the UAE and China can drive economic resilience, foster regional peace, and redefine global collaboration within the Global South. Key topics include financial innovation, industrial partnerships, and the UAE’s expanding role as a representative of the Gulf region in this emerging economic landscape.

                <h2>Arts & Culture Panel</h2>
                <h3>Developing Performing Arts: Cultural diversity and identity</h3>
                <p>We are witnessing the development of performing arts scene in both countries: diverse productions from across the world were invited, original productions stemming from unique culture roots were created, institutions promoting art’s development were established. We want to dive deeper into the developing field. 
                    Key questions include: What are the roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders in the performing arts scene in its development? With international exchange, how can we find our culture identity in a diverse environment? Can art be shared between Gulf and China? How can performing arts keep up with the development of technology?</p>

                <h2>Technology & Innovation Panel</h2>
                <h3>Developing Performing Arts: Cultural diversity and identity</h3>
                <p>This panel will explore how China and the Gulf can work together to build a better future using Space exploration and Technology. We will explore how satellites and space technology can be leveraged to improve disaster predictions, enhance resource management, and strengthen regional communication systems. It will also examine lessons the Gulf and China can share about integrating satellite data into disaster management frameworks. Looking toward the future, the session will highlight the Gulf’s and China’s plans for space missions and explore how the two regions can collaborate on ambitious projects, such as lunar and Mars exploration, and how partnerships in research and innovation can maximize the benefits of space exploration. A critical focus will be on developing policies to ensure the safe and sustainable use of outer space, including aligning on issues like space debris mitigation, satellite regulations, and governance frameworks. The panel will also discuss how China and the Gulf can inspire and engage students in space-related careers by sharing successful initiatives and programs that teach the next generation of space scientists, engineers, and policymakers. Additionally, it will address the importance of equitable sharing of space technology to support developing nations, helping with inclusivity and accessibility to space innovations. </p>
